# Meraki Captive Portal

_Static HTML/JS/CSS Site for a Click-through Splash Page_

## Overview

Cisco Meraki provides cloud managed WiFi with the ability to host your own "Splash Page", which is a captive portal service for authenticating users to join the network. This concept is called an External Captive Portal (ExCaP).

## WiFi4EU Support

This demo splash page includes the required script to comply with the policy.

## How it Works

Meraki provides two splash page modes, **click-through** and **sign-on**. This application will use the click-through method.

Just host these files in the public directory on any web server such as Apache or Firebase Hosting, configure your Meraki SSID to use your server and that's it!

### Sample URL received from Meraki to this page.

_You can use this URL to test your application without an access point_

```
http://localhost:5000/?base_grant_url=https%3A%2F%2Fn143.network-auth.com%2Fsplash%2Fgrant&user_continue_url=http%3A%2F%2Fspeedof.me%2F&node_id=149624922840090&node_mac=88:15:44:60:1c:1a&gateway_id=149624922840090&client_ip=10.255.60.208&client_mac=f4:5c:89:9b:17:67
```

## Installation

- Host these files on a webserver
- Update the `/public/index.html` file script with the wifi4eu details

```
<script type="text/javascript">
      var wifi4euTimerStart = Date.now();
      var wifi4euNetworkIdentifier = "NETWORK_IDENTIFIER"; // UPDATE WITH REAL VALUE
      var wifi4euLanguage = "PORTAL_LANGUAGE"; // UPDATE WITH REAL VALUE
    </script>
```

- Configure the Meraki wireless SSID with a Click-Through splash page authentication
  - Meraki Dashboard --> Configure --> Splash Page: Click-through
- Add the domain address of the webserver to the "Walled Garden"
  - Meraki Dashboard --> Configure --> Access Control --> SSID:yourSSID --> Walled Garden.
  - Note: You will need to use the IP address instead of the domain name or contact Meraki Support to enable Walled Garden Domain Names
- Point the Meraki Splash page "Customer URL" to the HTML file. `https://yourserver/`
  - Meraki Dashboard --> Configure --> Splash Page --> Custom URL: `https://yourserver.com/splash.html`
